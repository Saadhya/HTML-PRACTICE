            <p>Content writing isn’t an easy task. Whether you craft words for B2B or B2C audiences, the challenges
                can be many. I’ve created a diverse set of tips, tools, and resources to aid in shaping and
                modifying your work. It’s not an exhaustive collection. Some ideas may seem familiar. Others will be
                fresh.

                My hope is that you’ll walk away with some insights or new tools to help address or minimize the
                content creation challenges you face.

                Let’s get to it.

                1. Convey much with few words
                I find inspiration in ad copy that takes little space to reflect a strong message. Sure, you’ll need
                to write much more than a couple of sentences for your content marketing, but simplicity has merit.
                How well you write always sets the stage for what’s to come.

                Creativity can emerge in many ways. Sometimes, it’s a simple starting point. It might be wise to
                reflect the times and a significant sentiment. These examples tap into beauty, memes, a health
                crisis, and a love of pets.
